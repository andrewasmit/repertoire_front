# Repertoire

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is the React front-end to my Phase 3 Project for Flatiron School. It was styled with [Material UI](https://mui.com/). The back-end repo can be found [HERE](https://github.com/andrewasmit/repertoire).
